# Shipr

Shipr is a REST API and AngularJS client for deploying GitHub repositories using the [GitHub deployments api](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/).

## What happens?

1. You trigger a deploy via github (`POST https://api.github.com/repos/remind101/shipr/deployments`)
2. GitHub sends Shipr a POST request with the deployment event.
2. The app spins up a [deploy worker](./workers/deploy.worker) on Iron.io
3. The worker runs the [deploy script](./bin/deploy), which:
   1. Clones the repository
   2. Checks out the appropriate branch/tag/SHA
   3. Exports your config vars as environment variables
   4. Runs ./script/deploy within the cloned repository

## Why?

The main goal is to make it easier to create tooling for deploying.

## Setup

1. Create an OAuth application on GitHub.
2. Create an OAuth token with the `deployment_status` and `admin:repo_hook` scope.
3. Install Shipr on a heroku app:

   ```bash
   $ ./script/install <app name>
   ```

   **Running this on heroku will cost you money! (~$133/month)**

## Deploy Script

By default, Shipr will try to run `./script/deploy` inside your repository if
it exists. You can also specify a default script to use if none is provided via
the `DEPLOY_SCRIPT_URL` environment variable. We keep [our default deploy script](https://gist.github.com/ejholmes/474068635673c7f5c413/raw/deploy.sh)
in a gist.
